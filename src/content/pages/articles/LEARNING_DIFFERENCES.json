While often stigmatized as laziness or lack of intelligence, learning differences are not the result of poor effort or low IQ. In fact, many exceptionally intelligent and hard-working students struggle with unidentified learning disabilities. Learning differences are real neurological variations that require tailored interventions, accommodations, and supports to allow students to reach their potential. This article will explain what learning differences are, profile two common types - dyslexia and ADHD - and discuss key aspects of assessment and treatment."
