A gap as wide as the learning differences that affect 1 in 5 people, representing 70 million individuals in the U.S. alone. That gap was the lack of accessible and effective remote evaluations and support for learning differences such as dyslexia and ADHD. This is the story of how we filled that gap, of how we founded Polygon."

We equipped them with our proprietary remote assessment platform and a professional video-conferencing setup. We ensured they completed extensive training and strictly adhered to Polygon's clinical practices. Unlike online marketplaces that rely on hourly contract psychologists, we chose to make our clinicians full-time employees, offering them full benefits and equity compensation. This decision has been integral in ensuring the quality of service we provide."

User reviews have been constructive, helping us understand where we stand and how we can improve. But with every hurdle we've encountered, we've emerged stronger, more determined, and more focused on our mission."
