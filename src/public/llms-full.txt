## Missions

URL: https://merylldindin.com/missions/

### Unbounded Longevity

I believe humans can transcend biological limits. Through advances in AI-driven healthcare, regenerative medicine, and bioinformatics, we can extend healthspan dramatically. My work in digital health and predictive diagnostics aims to accelerate this vision of radical life extension.

### Sustainable City

I envision self-sustaining urban ecosystems powered by renewable energy, smart infrastructure, and decentralized governance. Cities should harmonize technology with nature, eliminating pollution while maximizing human flourishing. Building the future requires rethinking how we live together.

### Life-Long Academy

Education should never stop. I advocate for continuous learning systems that foster critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual autonomy. By leveraging AI and personalized curricula, we can empower individuals to keep growing throughout their extended lives.

Keywords: parallel learning, special education, K-12, teletherapy, edtech, healthtech, digital health, scale-up, AI

Parallel Learning is the leading K-12 teletherapy platform connecting schools with licensed special education providers. Through its ISO27001-certified technology, Parallel delivers psychoeducational assessments, speech therapy, and specialized instruction to students with learning differences across 25+ states.

Meryll joined Parallel in July 2023 through the acquisition of Polygon. Starting as the sole data hire, he mapped the entire technology ecosystem within 48 hours, then shipped the Capacity Dashboard and Provider Pay system by August 2023. He cleared all legacy technical debt and reduced data processing from 7 minutes to 1 minute per iteration.

By April 2024, he launched Pathway — Parallel's proprietary platform managing student data, session calendars, provider workflows, and facilitator operations. He grew the engineering team from solo to eight cross-functional members covering data engineering, product management, software engineering, and applied AI.

He managed the full ISO 27001:2022 certification, authored FERPA compliance documentation, and led penetration testing and vendor compliance reviews. As VP of Product and Engineering (mid-2025), he defined the AI strategy including intelligent agents for clinical workflows, a generative AI platform, and AI-powered support within Pathway.

At HLTH 2025, he received the Digital Health Hub Rising Star award in Mental and Behavioral Health on behalf of Parallel. During 2024-2025, Parallel delivered 77,000+ sessions across 18 states with 98% of students meeting or exceeding IEP goals.
